# spvn

spvn is a work in progress project which seeks to bring rust asgi bindings into python. it is in progress, contributions & development are welcome

## ASGI State Management

```mermaid

stateDiagram-v2
    Request--> Bytes
    Bytes --> PyDelayed(receive)
    PyDelayed(receive) --> PyFuture(received)
    PyFuture(received) --> PythonPtr(bytes)

    PythonPtr(bytes) --> ASGI
    PythonPtr(received) --> ASGI
    PythonPtr(scope) --> ASGI

    Request --> asgi_from_request
    asgi_from_request --> PythonPtr(scope)

    Send --> SendReceiver
    Send --> PyDelayed(send)
    PyDelayed(send) --> PyFuture(sent)
    PyFuture(sent) --> None


    PyDelayed(scope) --> Caller.call
    PyDelayed(send) --> Caller.call
    PyDelayed(receive) --> Caller.call

    Caller.call --> await

    ASGI --> SendReceiver

    SendReceiver --> ReceiveStart
    SendReceiver --> ReceiveBody

    ReceiveStart --> Response
    ReceiveBody --> Response

```

## Project Status

Roughly in order of priority

- [âœ…] Integrate standard import semantics

- [âœ…] PyCaller
  - [âœ…] (rust) Async safe integration
  - [âœ…] Abstract (py fn) async / sync handle
  - [âœ…] Caller pool [this will be revised, its too slow]
- [ðŸš§] Standard asgi traits & structs
  - [ðŸš§] ASGIScope
    - [âœ…] (rust) Async safe integration
    - [ðŸš§] Conversion from `tower::Body` -> `dict`
  - [âœ…] ASGIVersion
  - [ðŸš§] ASGIMessage
    - [âœ…] Lifecycle Scope
    - [âœ…] HTTP Lifecycle Scope
    - [ðŸš§] Websockets (msg integration)
- [âœ…] App listener
- [ðŸš§] App dispatcher
  - [âœ…] Async threadsafe
  - [ðŸš§] Lifecycle activation for caller objects
- [ðŸš§] App scheduler

  - [âœ…] Injectable `awaitables` (rust ptr -> python ptr)
  - [âœ…] Async threadsafe
  - [âœ…] Delayed py-fn call
  - [ðŸš§] Scheduler into py

- [ðŸš§] Live reloader
- [ðŸš§] Websockets

## Rationale & Goals

- Relieve limits by python in networking applications
  - The goal is not to create the 'fastest' ASGI server, but reliable ASGI services which don't drop calls when subject to extreme concurrency
- Safe python threadpooling unmanaged by GIL runtime

### Claims

The upper bounds of python concurrency are not <i>really</i> production ready

#### Rationale

- Uvicorn drops requests & stalls on IO > 7500 concurrent clients
- Hypercorn drops requests & stalls on IO > 7500 concurrent clients

In both, we must horizontally scale to accomodate these limits in our systems. This is further accompanied by essentially a second layer of IO bound processes, which are evidently unable to maintain highly concurrent environments

#### Proposed

Delegation of connection multiplex, stream, and IO processes into Rust, and autoinjection at runtime following standard ASGI protocol.

### Preliminary Tests

- perf has test files containing basic benchmarks
  - hypercorn @ 1 worker = 683402-788307 ns
  - spvn -> py @ 1 worker = 159201-221808 ns

This is a <i>very</i> preliminary implementation of the caller protocol using async processes.

#### Visualization

Tests performed using [ali](https://github.com/nakabonne/ali). See [perf/ali](./perf/ali/README.md) for methodology.

## Developing

### Pre-requisites

#### Python >= 3.9

1. Use virtualenv / venv

```bash
python3.10 -m (venv|virtualenv) env && \
        . ./env/bin/activate && \
        pip install maturin
```

2. Test bindings by running

```bash
maturin develop
```

#### Rust >= 1.69.0

- Build CLI

```bash
cargo build
```

- Run CLI

```bash
target/debug/spvn serve dotest.foo:app
```
